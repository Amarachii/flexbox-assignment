## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my flexbox project in my scholarship HerTechTrail and this is like my toughest project so far and it took some good time to finally understand and digest it properly thanks to our great instructor and some of my fellow trailers in my track.

## The challenge

 I found it hard to understand and memorise the different styles for the parent and children. I was a slow learner in this I won't lie.

This was my main challenge and when I got it , it made the project so much easier to understand.
Frankly speaking now, Flexbox is easy when one calms down to really understand it.

## About my project:

As aforementioned, this is a flexbox project which is responsiv and users can view the website on any device screen size.

There is a different hover effect for each of the 'Learn more' buttons when the user hovers on the button.

I also nested the 'Learn more' button in a link that takes the user directly to a site where they can actually rent cars just to add a little life to the project.
 I designed the link to open the site on a new tab that is; a different webpage.

## Building my project

The steps of building my project:

Our instructor sent us the project(more like guidelines and helping tools to build the project) in the classroom.

Firstly, I forked the project
Secondly, I cloned the project and saved in my desktop
Thirdly, I used the guidelines and tools to create my own project.
Fourthly, I updated the readMe file 
Finally I initialized my project, added my new files, committed the changes and pushed my project to the github repo of the project I forked using my gitbash.

## Deploying your project

I deployed my project using github and netlify.

To deploy on github, I clicked on settings in my repository, scrolled to github pages and clicked on it, I made sure the it was on the main branch(which i worked on) and in the root folder then saved my project then github helped deploy the project and created a link to view my site.

To deploy on netlify, I imported my project from my github and simply deployed it. After my site has been deployed I clicked on site settings and changed my site name to my preferred name.

## References
Well Google as always was there for me when I got tangled up in confusion.

I visited various sites that I don't even remember their names.I just wanted to find the right one with the helpful info.
Google is always there for all learners out there and I never hesitate to implore its assistance

## Conclusion

I learnt alot while working on this project and also unlearnt a few things as well and this made me really happy. 
This also made me realize that as a web developer, you learn more from building more projects.

in conclusion, despite the fact that this was one of the toughest project I have worked on so far, it was also like my best and a big eye-opening project.
